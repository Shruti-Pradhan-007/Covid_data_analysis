# SQL_Covid_data_analysis

In this SQL project, I have analyzed the trends observed during the Covid-19 pandemic faced across the world using the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations data tables of Covid-19 dataset for time period ranging from March 2020 to June 2021.

This exploratory data analysis has showcased skills such as: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions.

The Covid-19 dataset was downloaded from the following website: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I have used MS-SQL Server and imported the Excel files to a SQL Database created in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
